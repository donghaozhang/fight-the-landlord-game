### 24. 🔄 Display all player cards instead of "+X more cards" indicator
- [ ] Remove card display limit and show complete hands
- [ ] Implement dynamic spacing for variable card counts (3-20 cards)
- [ ] Optimize card arrangement algorithms for full visibility
- [ ] Remove more-cards-indicator UI component
- [ ] Enhance game transparency by showing actual card counts visually
- [ ] **IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**:
  1. **Modify game.js renderComputerCards() method**:
     - Change `const maxDisplayCards = Math.min(cardCount, 15);` to `const maxDisplayCards = cardCount;`
     - Or completely remove maxDisplayCards and use cardCount directly
     - Remove the conditional block that creates more-cards-indicator (lines 425-433)
  2. **Update spacing calculations**:
     - Enhance overlap algorithms to handle 3-20 cards dynamically
     - For vertical layout: adjust baseOverlap based on cardCount for optimal stacking
     - For horizontal layout: adjust baseOverlap based on cardCount for optimal spreading
  3. **Test card count scenarios**:
     - Test with 3 cards (minimum after some cards played)
     - Test with 17 cards (initial deal)
     - Test with 20 cards (landlord with bonus cards)
     - Verify no overflow from player containers
  4. **Responsive optimization**:
     - Ensure mobile devices can handle 20 cards without horizontal scrolling
     - Adjust card sizes on smaller screens if necessary
  5. **Remove unused CSS**:
     - Delete `.more-cards-indicator` and related styles from cards.css
- [ ] **TECHNICAL DETAILS**:
  - Current limit: `const maxDisplayCards = Math.min(cardCount, 15);` in game.js line 310
  - More cards indicator: Created when `cardCount > maxDisplayCards` at game.js line 425-428
  - CSS class: `.more-cards-indicator` styling in cards.css lines 555-588
  - Need to adjust overlap calculations to accommodate 3-20 cards dynamically
  - Vertical player (left): optimize margin-top spacing for card stacking
  - Horizontal player (top): optimize margin-left spacing for card spreading
  - Remove totalCards = maxDisplayCards assignment at line 329
  - Remove conditional more cards creation logic at lines 425-433
- [ ] **EXPECTED OUTCOME**:
  - All player cards visible at all times (no hidden cards)
  - Smooth, natural card arrangement regardless of card count
  - Proper spacing that scales with number of cards
  - Enhanced game transparency - players can see actual card counts visually
