# Card Game Project Tasks

## Project Overview
This is a card game project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.

## Current Tasks

### 1. ✅ Create task.md file
- [x] Document project tasks and progress

### 2. ✅ Copy image files to project folder
- [x] Copy relevant images from d:\AI_play\AI_Code\Flowith
- [x] Organize images in appropriate folder structure
- [x] Optimize images for web use if needed

### 3. ✅ Add images for game use
- [x] Identify which images to use for cards/game elements
- [x] Update game code to reference new images
- [x] Test image loading in game

### 4. ✅ Rename cards for poker game consistency
- [x] Analyze current card naming scheme
- [x] Create consistent naming convention (e.g., spade_ace.png, heart_king.png)
- [x] Rename key identifiable images to follow poker standard
- [x] Update JavaScript card mapping to use new names
- [x] Create backup of original images

### 5. ✅ Improve card visibility
- [x] Increase card size for better viewing (50x70px → 80x112px)
- [x] Adjust layout to accommodate larger cards
- [x] Ensure responsive design still works (mobile: 60x84px)
- [x] Test on different screen sizes

### 6. ✅ Convert game to English
- [x] Change all Chinese text to English in HTML
- [x] Update JavaScript messages and player names to English
- [x] Translate game controls and buttons
- [x] Update CSS role labels (Landlord/Farmer)
- [x] Test complete English interface

### 7. ✅ Create shorter card image names
- [x] Rename card images to very short names (e.g., "ht.png" for Hearts Ten)
- [x] Create systematic naming: suits (s,h,c,d) + ranks (a,2-9,t,j,q,k)
- [x] Update JavaScript mapping to use shorter names
- [x] Test image loading with new names

### 8. ✅ Add card hover enlargement effect
- [x] Add CSS hover effects to enlarge cards on mouse over (scale 1.3x)
- [x] Implement smooth transitions for hover state (0.3s ease)
- [x] Ensure enlargement doesn't affect layout (z-index management)
- [x] Test hover effects on all card types

### 9. ✅ Prepare for GitHub repository
- [x] Create .gitignore file to exclude images folder
- [x] Generate JSON file with image name mappings (long name → short name)
- [x] Create README.md for GitHub repository
- [x] Initialize Git repository structure
- [x] Test repository setup without large image files

### 10. ✅ Deploy to GitHub
- [x] Initialize Git repository locally
- [x] Stage and commit all project files
- [x] Create GitHub repository: fight-the-landlord-game
- [x] Push code to GitHub: https://github.com/donghaozhang/fight-the-landlord-game
- [x] Verify repository is public and accessible

### 11. ✅ Complete card image renaming system
- [x] Use images.json mapping to rename all 113 long-named images to short names
- [x] Implement systematic renaming: suits (s,h,c,d) + ranks (a,2-9,t,j,q,k) + jokers (jr,jb)
- [x] Map long descriptive names to appropriate card positions
- [x] Update JavaScript to use only short names for all cards
- [x] Create PowerShell script for bulk renaming operation
- [x] Verify all 54 playing cards (52 standard + 2 jokers) have unique short names
- [x] Test game functionality with complete short-named deck

### 12. ✅ Improve computer player card visualization
- [x] Increase card overlap for more realistic card hand appearance
- [x] Adjust spacing and stacking for better visual depth
- [x] Ensure proper z-index management for card layering
- [x] Test overlap with different card counts (few cards vs many cards)
- [x] Maintain hover effects while cards are overlapped
